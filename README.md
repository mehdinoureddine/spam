# spam
project python for data analysis

Given a dataset of information about recieved emails, we want to predict if an email is a spam or not, thanks to machine learning algorithms.
To conclude, we can predict with a precision of 95% if an email is a spam or not, given the information needed.
However, this result is very high because the test set was made by splitting the dataset, which means that, given another email out of the dataset, the results might not
be that high.
